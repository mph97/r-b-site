    <h1>The Problem</h1>

    <h2>90s-00s Peak</h2>
    <p>One look at the Billboard charts of the 1990s through the mid-2000s will show that R&amp;B was one of the most popular genres,
        if not the most popular. R&amp;B *was* pop music and it wasn&apos;t uncommon for albums and songs to hold the top spots for weeks
        at a time. In the 90s, artists like Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, Brandy, Usher, and SWV were able to find mainstream success with their music. 
        During the early to mid-2000s, Usher, Ne-Yo, Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, and Alicia Keys, to name a few, were topping the charts 
        and their music was inescapable.
    </p>

    <h2>Late 00s decline</h2>
    <p>Around 08-09, there was a shift in the sound of R&amp;B. Some of the genre&apos;s most popular artists were incorporating 
        Eurodance production into their music which was jarring to their audiences. At the same time, Hip-Hop was dominating. Albums 
        such as Kanye West's '808s and Heartbreaks' proved to be a gamechanger with Wests singing over Electronic influenced Hip-Hop and R&amp;B. 
        This style influenced artists like Drake who broke through with his ability to fuse R&amp;B sensibilites with his raps. Consumers 
        naturally gravitated towards this new phenomenon happening and, as a result, R&amp;B artists suffered. Artists had to adapt to 
        a downtempo production style heavily influenced by hip-hop that favored a more drawn back approach to the traditional 
        singing style most were used to.</p>

    <h2>Rise of "Alt-R&B"</h2>
    <p>During the 2010s, this new sound that had fully taken over R&amp;B was dubbed "Alternative R&B". Frank Ocean, The Weeknd, and Jhene Aiko 
        can be credited as the faces of the genre, mixing elements from multiple genres with introspective, sometimes stream-of-consciousness, type 
        songwriting. For a while, their styles were replicated over and over again. Music listeners were satisfied enough with the music they were getting, 
        but, for the most part, Hip-Hop's dominance as the leading genre had overshadowed nearly all of recent R&amp;B releases.  </p>
